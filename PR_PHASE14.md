# PR: Phase 14 — UX & interaction polish

## Summary
This PR polishes the UI with empty states, selection highlights, a file details
drawer, and basic context menus for common actions.

## Changes
- Empty catalog placeholder and search/no-results messaging.
- Selection highlighting for volumes, directories, virtual folders, and files.
- File details drawer (notes/tags + info) and file selection property.
- Volume context menu (rescan/rename/reveal) and file context menu (copy path, add to virtual folder).
- New helper invokables for clipboard and volume rename.

## Why
- Makes the app feel coherent and user-friendly with clear feedback.
- Aligns interactions with KDE/Plasma expectations.

## Testing
- Not run (manual GUI smoke test recommended).
