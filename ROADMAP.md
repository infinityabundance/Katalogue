# Katalogue Roadmap

This document lists ideas and planned directions for Katalogue after the 1.0 release.

## Short-term

- Improve performance on very large catalogs (indexing and searching).
- Optional plugin system for metadata extractors (audio, image, documents).
- More flexible tag-based and smart-collection queries.
- Better keyboard navigation and shortcuts.

## Medium-term

- Thumbnail / preview panel for supported file types (opt-in, configurable).
- Advanced export formats and scripting hooks.
- Deeper KDE integration (KIO, Baloo, etc.) where appropriate.

## Long-term

- Optional remote catalog backends (SSH / HTTP) while keeping on-disk catalog format simple.
- Shared catalog mode (read-only multi-user access).
